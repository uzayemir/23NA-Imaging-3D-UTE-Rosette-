# Compressed sensing and the use of 3D UTE dual-echo rosette k-space trajectory for high-resolution accelerated 23NA imaging at 3T

We have developed a novel 23Na ultrashort echo time (UTE) sequence with a 3D rosette k-space trajectory [1] to improve spatial resolution and with dual echo to enable quantification of T2* constant, which is also correlated with tissue health. We then benchmark our novel sequence against the gold-standard fast 23Na MRI technique with 3D density-adapted radial k-space acquisition [2].
