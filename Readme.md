To that end, we have developed a novel
23Na ultrashort echo time (UTE) sequence with a 3D rosette k-space trajectory [5] to improve spatial resolution and with dual echo to enable quantification of
T2* constant, which is also correlated with tissue health. We then benchmark our novel sequence against the gold-standard fast 23Na MRI technique with 3D
radial k-space acquisition [6].
